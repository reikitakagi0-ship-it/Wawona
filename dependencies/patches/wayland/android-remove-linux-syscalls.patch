# Patch: Remove Linux-specific syscalls for Android (Bionic libc)
#
# Android's Bionic libc lacks signalfd, timerfd, and other Linux syscalls
# that are available in glibc but not in Bionic. This patch removes or
# replaces them with Android-compatible alternatives.
#
# This is a placeholder patch file. Replace with actual patch content.
#
# Reference: Paalanen's Weston port to Android removed these syscalls
# See: https://ppaalanen.blogspot.com/2012/04/first-light-from-weston-on-android.html
