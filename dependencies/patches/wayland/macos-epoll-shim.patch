# Patch: Use epoll-shim for macOS compatibility
#
# macOS doesn't have epoll, but epoll-shim provides a compatible interface
# using kqueue. This patch ensures Wayland uses epoll-shim on macOS.
#
# This is a placeholder patch file. Replace with actual patch content.
#
# Note: Instead of a patch file, you might use postPatch in build.nix:
#   postPatch = ''
#     substituteInPlace src/event-loop.c \
#       --replace "#include <sys/epoll.h>" "#include <epoll-shim/epoll.h>"
#   '';
