# Patch: Disable Linux-specific GPU paths for macOS
#
# macOS doesn't support Linux DMA-BUF or libgbm. This patch disables those
# paths and ensures waypipe uses Vulkan/Metal fallback (via Kosmickrisp).
#
# This is a placeholder patch file. Replace with actual patch content.
#
# Similar to iOS patch, but may need macOS-specific adjustments for
# Vulkan-on-Metal integration.
