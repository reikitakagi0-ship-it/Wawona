# Patch: Ensure waypipe uses KosmicKrisp Vulkan driver on macOS
#
# This patch ensures waypipe-rs properly detects and uses the KosmicKrisp
# Vulkan driver on macOS. It may need to:
# - Set VK_ICD_FILENAMES to point to KosmicKrisp ICD
# - Ensure Vulkan loader finds the KosmicKrisp .dylib
# - Configure waypipe to use Vulkan features available in KosmicKrisp
# - Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or use rpath to find KosmicKrisp library
#
# This is a placeholder patch file. Replace with actual patch content.
# To generate a patch:
#   1. Clone waypipe repository
#   2. Make your changes to ensure KosmicKrisp integration
#   3. Run: git diff > macos-kosmickrisp-vulkan.patch
