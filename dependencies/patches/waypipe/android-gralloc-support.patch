# Patch: Android gralloc/DMA-BUF support
#
# Android supports DMA-BUF via gralloc buffers. This patch ensures waypipe
# properly integrates with Android's gralloc system for buffer sharing.
#
# This is a placeholder patch file. Replace with actual patch content.
#
# Android has DMA-BUF support, but the integration may need adjustments
# for Android's specific gralloc implementation.
