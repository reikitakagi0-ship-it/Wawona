# Patch: Disable Linux-specific GPU paths for iOS
#
# iOS doesn't support Linux DMA-BUF or libgbm. This patch disables those
# paths and ensures waypipe falls back to shared-memory or Vulkan/Metal.
#
# This is a placeholder patch file. Replace with actual patch content.
#
# Note: Some of this can be handled via Meson build flags:
#   -Ddmabuf=false -Dvaapi=false
# But code paths that check for these features may need patching.
